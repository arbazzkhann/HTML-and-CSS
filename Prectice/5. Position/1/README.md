# Positions in CSS

## Relative:
* Position relative only used for off set properties (left, right, top, bottom).
* Positioned from its original location.

## Absolute:
* Breaks normal flow.
* Removed space in dom (removes its actual place of space).
* Positioned as per closest positioned ancestor (if didn't find positioned ancestor positioned with HTML tag).
